kaggle_kenjee_titanic_example
This is not code that I wrote myself, Ken Jee wrote it and it can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kenjee/titanic-project-example/notebook
I uploaded it to test how to upload a repo and to document that I spent about 12 hours replicating and comprehending it.
The code I wrote while replicating was lost on kaggle due to unknown reasons. 
It used to be accessable trough https://www.kaggle.com/juliansauter/titanic-js/edit
